## 🧹 1. Data Cleaning

### Basic Cleaning
- Convert `Order_Date` → `datetime`
- Check missing values using `isnull()`
- Remove duplicate records
- Fix data types (`int`, `float`)

### Column-wise Cleaning
- `Customer_Age` → Remove unrealistic values (age `< 18` or `> 80`)
- `Customer_Gender` → Standardize to `Male` / `Female` only

### Regex Cleaning 🔥
- Extract year/month from date columns
- Clean dealer names (remove extra whitespace)
- Standardize city/state names

```python
import re
df['City'] = df['City'].str.replace(r'\s+', ' ', regex=True)
```

---

## 📊 2. Analysis

### 💰 Sales Analysis
- Total sales by **Year / Month**
- Total sales by **State / City**

### 👥 Customer Analysis
- Age distribution across buyers
- Gender-wise purchase breakdown
- Preferred payment methods

### 🚀 Business Insights
- Which bike model generates the highest profit
- Which city generates maximum revenue
- Online vs Showroom sales comparison

### ⏱️ Operational Insights
- Delivery days vs customer rating
- Does faster delivery correlate with better ratings?

---

## 📈 3. Visualizations

### 📅 Sales Trends
- **Line Chart** → Sales over time
- **Pie Chart** → Payment mode distribution (UPI / Cash / Credit Card)

### 🏆 Top Models / Cities
- **Bar Chart** → Top bike models by sales
- **Bar Chart** → Top cities by revenue

### 👥 Customer Insights
- **Pie Chart** → Gender distribution
- **Bar Chart** → Age distribution

---

## 🚀 4. Feature Engineering

Create a new `Profit_Percent` column:

```python
df['Profit_Percent'] = (df['Gross_Profit'] / df['Cost_Price']) * 100
```

### Prediction Goals
- Identify which factors affect profit the most
- Predict which customers are likely to buy expensive bikes
